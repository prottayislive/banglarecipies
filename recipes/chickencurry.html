        <li>3 medium onions</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of Garlic and Ginger paste</li>
        <li>5 Green Cardamom pods</li>
        <li>1 and a quarter tablespoons of Coriander powder</li>
        <li>2 Bay Leaves</li>
        <li>2 Inch piece of Cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of Cumin powder</li>
        <li>Quarter Teaspoon of Turmeric Powder</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon of Salt</li>
        <li>Half Teaspoon of Red Chili Powder</li>
        <li>Half Teaspoon of Madras Curry Powder</li>
        <li>3-4 Tablespoons of cooking oil</li>
        <li>Fresh Coriander to Garnish</li>
        <li>180ml of Boiling water from Kettle</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>STEP 1</li>
        <p> Heat the oil in a heavy based pot on a medium heat, then add chopped Onions, Bay leaves, Cardamom pods, Cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of salt. Cook on a low to medium flame, stirring occasionally, until Onions are translucent about 8-10 minutes.</p>
        <li>STEP 2</li>
        <p> After Onions have been cooking for around 8-10 minutes, add 2 tablespoons of Garlic and Ginger paste, stir and cook for a further 5-7 minutes, again stirring to make sure it doesn't burn. (Don't use the G&G in jars it doesn't taste the same as fresh, I buy the Raj frozen minced Garlic and Ginger from Morrison's, Asda etc, it's 100% fresh.</p>
        <li>STEP 3</li>
        <p> Now add the Spice! Add your Coriander powder, Cumin powder, Chili powder, Curry powder and Turmeric powder. Mix and stir the mixture well and cook on a low heat until the oil separates from the masala, about 5-7 minutes. Again stir frequently to avoid mixture burning.</p>
        <li>STEP 4</li>
        <p> Add your skinless Chicken thighs and mix well, coating them in the Onion mixture. Cook them for 3-4 minutes stirring on a medium heat. (I use on the bone thighs, skin removed, that I chop in half with a Cleaver or Heavy knife)</p>
        <li>STEP 5</li>
        <p> Now boil the kettle. Add 180ml of boiling water to the mixture and stir and mix well. Cover and cook on a low flame, stirring now and again, until the Chicken is cooked through. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Stir in some fresh chopped Coriander once the Chicken is done.</p>
        <li>STEP 6</li>
        <p> Taste the Curry to see if you want to add anymore salt. Serve with Basmati Rice or Chapati's. Enjoy!</p>
        <li>STEP 7</li>
        <p> NOTE you can get creative with this dish by adding either Potatoes, Vegetables or Chana Dall. I like to add some grated lemon rind.</p>
